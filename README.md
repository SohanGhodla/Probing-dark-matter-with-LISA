# Probing-dark-matter-with-LISA


This repository contains the jupyter notebooks required to reproduce the figures in the paper titled: _[Galactic and extragalactic probe of dark matter with LISAâ€™s binary black holes near their galactic center](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15562)_. 


 - The `particle-like-dark-matter.ipynb` contains the code used for calculation when a particle-like dark matter candidate was involved.
 - The `scalar-field-dark-matter.ipynb` contains the code used for calculation when a massive scalar field dark matter candidate was involved.
